## hack(Comedy) web application

![cover image](/src/assets/img/Brand_Interface_group.png)

> “Hack(Comedy)” is a computational comedy interface that aims to interrogate our perception of humor through a procedurally live generation that copies and reflects condensed themes and identities in the American comedy landscape. The artist undertakes an unexpected method of programming to achieve comic absurdity by generating materials from borrowed comic sources.

## How to interact

- <b>Create</b>: instantiate virtual comedians that are trained with their scraped stand-up transcripts
- <b>Write</b>: you can freely write with any individual virtual comedian.
- <b>Group Improv</b>: you can write to multiple selected virtual comedians at the same time, watching them generate different outcomes.
- <b>Rant</b>: Watch any virtual comedian generates on its own term
